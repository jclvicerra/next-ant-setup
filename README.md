# Ant + NextJS
- Ant with custom theme and sass variables for reuse
- this setup does not require customization of webpack, hence you can leverage out the built-in features like css modules, sass support without any extra configuration
- this setup can be used for react-cra too for the reason mentioned above

## Setup Instructions

1. npm install -g less

  - creates and outputs compiled css to result.css file in styles folder
  - creates and outputs sass variables to sass-vars.scss file
